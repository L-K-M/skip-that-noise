# Cuts a release: bumps the version in manifest.json, updates the README
# <!-- version --> marker (if present), commits, tags "v<version>", and with --push
# pushes branch + tag — which triggers .github/workflows/release.yml. CI re-checks
# that the tag matches manifest.json, then packages the extension with web-ext
# (signing through Mozilla Add-ons when AMO credentials are configured, otherwise an
# unsigned .zip) and publishes the GitHub Release. CI packages the *committed* sources
# and takes the artifact's version (and filename, e.g. skip_that_noise-1.0.1.zip) from
# manifest.json — the tag only triggers the workflow and names the Release; it is NOT
# the version source. So the committed version and the tag must agree (the release.yml
# guard fails the build otherwise). manifest.json is the single source of truth for the
# version; package.json is tooling config and declares no version, so the engine leaves
# it untouched.
#
#   scripts/release.sh 1.3.0          # bump manifest.json + README, commit, tag v1.3.0
#   scripts/release.sh 1.3.0 --push   # …also push the commit + tag (CI then publishes)
#   scripts/release.sh                # tag the current version as-is
#
# Usage: scripts/release.sh [X.Y.Z] [--push]
# Shared engine: https://github.com/L-K-M/release-tool (this stub only sets config).
