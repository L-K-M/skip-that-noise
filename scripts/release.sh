# Cuts a release: bumps the version, commits, tags "v<version>", and with --push
# pushes branch + tag — which triggers .github/workflows/release.yml to build the
# unsigned .zip (web-ext build) and publish the GitHub Release. web-ext builds the
# .zip from the *committed* sources and takes the artifact's version (and filename,
# e.g. skip_that_noise-1.0.1.zip) from manifest.json — the tag only triggers the
# workflow and names the Release; CI does NOT derive the extension version from the
# tag. So the committed version and the tag must agree, or you'd ship a release named
# "v1.5.0" containing a 1.0.1 extension. manifest.json is the only place the version
# is declared (package.json holds just the web-ext dependency and has no version
# field, so the engine leaves it untouched).
#
#   scripts/release.sh 1.3.0          # bump manifest.json + README, commit, tag v1.3.0
#   scripts/release.sh 1.3.0 --push   # …also push the commit + tag (CI then publishes)
#   scripts/release.sh                # tag the current version as-is
#
# Usage: scripts/release.sh [X.Y.Z] [--push]
# Shared engine: https://github.com/L-K-M/release-tool (this stub only sets config).
